## What I Build
- Interactive applications with clear logic and structured code
- Web apps that consume real APIs and handle user input cleanly
- Personal tools and projects that prioritize usability and maintainability

## Selected Projects
- **SecureVault**   Full‑stack password manager with encrypted vault storage, password strength analysis, breach checking and 2FA
- **Personal Inflation Tracker**  Full stack web application with integrated FRED API and KPI cards
- **Personal Portfolio**  Designed and built from scratch, deployed at dhruvdave.ca 

> I focus on building projects that work end-to-end and are easy to reason about, not just things that look good in screenshots.
